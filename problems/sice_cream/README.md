# sice_cream

> Just pwn this [program](sice_cream) and get a flag. Connect with `nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 5033`. [libc.so.6](libc.so.6) [ld-2.23.so](ld-2.23.so).

> Hints: Make sure to both files are in the same directory as the executable, and set `LD_PRELOAD` to the path of `libc.so.6`

We are given a stripped binary called `sice_cream` as well as two libc files: `libc.so.6` and `ld-2.23.so`. Therefore, we know we are working in GLIBC version 2.23. When running (with `LD_PRELOAD=./libc.so.6`; also make sure all three files are marked as executable), we are prompted for a name, then greeted with a four option menu: `Buy sice cream`, `Eat sice cream`, `Reintroduce yourself`, and `Exit`. Before we move on, let's also take a look at the checksec for this problem:
```
[*] '/.../sice_cream'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
    RUNPATH:  './'
```
Notably, `Full RELRO` means the GOT is not writeable, which rules out quite a few attack vectors. Having `PIE` disabled is nice though, and suggests that we might need to use a fixed address of some function or global variable in our exploit. After a bit of messing around, our next logical step is to reverse the binary. With some Ghidra, `objdump`, and `gdb`, we get:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <ctype.h>

// note: creams is stored in memory right after name
char name[256];
char* creams[20];

// 0x400cc4
void printfile(char *filename){
	char c;
	FILE *file;
	
	file = fopen(filename,"r");
	if (file != NULL) {
		while (1) {
			c = getc(file);
			if (c == 0xff) break;
			putchar(c);
		}
	}
}

int get_num_creams() {
  int ct;
  for (ct = 0; creams[ct] != NULL; ct++) {
    if (ct > 19) {
      return -1;
    }
  }
  return ct;
}

void eat() {
	char buf[24];
	puts("Which sice cream do you want to eat?");
	printf("> ");
	read(0,buf,16);
	uint which = (uint)strtoul(buf,NULL,10);
	if (which > 19) {
		puts("Invalid index!");
		exit(-1);
	}
	// horrible, allows double free
	free(creams[which]);
	puts("Yum!");
}

void buy() {
	char buf[24];
	int num_creams = get_num_creams();
	if (num_creams < 0) {
		puts("Out of space!");
		exit(-1);
	}
	puts("How much sice cream do you want?");
	printf("> ");
	read(0,buf,16);
	uint amt = (uint)strtoul(buf,NULL,10);
	if (amt > 88) {
		puts("That\'s too much sice cream!");
		exit(-1);
	}
	char* newcream = malloc(amt);
	creams[num_creams] = newcream;
	puts("What flavor?");
	printf("> ");
	read(0,creams[num_creams],amt);
	puts("Here you go!");
}

// If name is not null-terminated (i.e. we fill all 256 chars)
// then rename() will leak creams[0]
void reintroduce() {
	puts("What\'s your name again?");
	printf("> ");
	read(0,name,256);
	printf("Ah, right! How could a forget a name like %s!\n",name);
}

void menu() {
	puts("1. Buy sice cream");
	puts("2. Eat sice cream");
	puts("3. Reintroduce yourself");
	puts("4. Exit");
}

void main() {
	int choice;
	char buf[24];
	setvbuf(stdin,NULL,_IONBF,0);
	setvbuf(stdout,NULL,_IONBF,0);
	puts("Welcome to the Sice Cream Store!");
	puts("We have the best sice cream in the world!");
	puts("Whats your name?");
	printf("> ");
	read(0,name,256);

	while (1) {
		menu();
		printf("> ");
		read(0,buf,16);
		choice = (int)strtoul(buf,NULL,10);
		switch(choice) {
			case 1:
				buy();
				break;

				break;
			case 3:
				reintroduce();
				break;
			case 4:

			default:

	}
}
```
Obviously, this is a heap exploitation problem. We also note a few things:
- We are restricted to `buy`ing pointers of fastbin size (in fact, maxing out at `0x58`).
- There is an unreferenced function at `0x400cc4` that prints out the file given by its argument.
- Eating a sice cream `free`s the respective pointer, but does not `NULL` it out in `creams`. This allows us to potentially abuse a double free.
- `name` is directly above `creams` in memory.
- If we `reintroduce` with a name of the full length `256`, we can leak the first pointer in `creams`.

Since most heap problems require a libc leak at some point, we think of ways to do this. Unfortunately, we can only allocate fastbin size chunks, which will not produce libc pointers. If only we could make a smallbin chunk...

The key observation to make from here is that `rename` lets us have total control of `256` bytes (actually `255` because of the forced `\n`) in memory. We actually _can_ make a smallbin chunk: a forged one in `name`. Of course, we wouldn't be able to free that smallbin chunk to actually get the libc pointers written in unless we controlled `creams`.

But we can in fact control `creams`! Remembering that `name` is right above `creams` in memory, we realize that we can use a  double free into fastbin forward pointer poisoning to get `malloc` to return a fake chunk in `name`, right above `creams`! Thus, we will write into `name` the following data:
```
[name]
0x602040:    0x0000000000000000    0x00000000000000c1
0x602050:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x602060:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x602070:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x602080:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x602090:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x6020a0:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x6020b0:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x6020c0:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x6020d0:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x6020e0:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x6020f0:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x602100:    0x00000000000000c1    0x0000000000000031
0x602110:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x602120:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000000
0x602130:    0x0000000000000000    0x0000000000000041
[creams]
0x602140:    ...
```
By abusing double free, we can coerce malloc into returning the chunk at `0x602130`, which in turn means we can write `0x602040` into `creams[0]`, and thus free our fake fastbin chunk by `eat`ing `0`. (The chunk in between is to pass corruption checks.) If we do this, `name` will begin like so:
```
0x602040:    0x0000000000000000    0x00000000000000c1
0x602050:    <  libc pointer  >    <  libc pointer  >
```
... and reintroducing ourselves with the name `AAAAAAAABBBBBBBB` will allow us to leak libc.

From here, we might get stuck. Ideally, we would finish by using the same exploit and tricking `malloc` into returning a fake (misaligned) chunk of size `7f` right above `__malloc_hook`, then writing what we want into `__malloc_hook`. But such a chunk would be of fastbin size, and we can only allocate chunks of size up to `0x60`, so that wouldn't work.

Eventually, we remember than we are in libc 2.23, which is coincidentally the version right before an exploit called House of Orange was patched. This exploit (in a _very_ brief nutshell; see [here](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.25/house_of_orange.c) for more details, referring to "phase two" of the attack) allows us to call an arbitrary function with a string by `malloc`ing after `free`ing a smallbin chunk for which we can write to after being freed. We might consider the standard `system("/bin/sh")`; however, when this is manually tested, we notice that `system` will silently crash and do nothing. This limitation is because we are using `LD_PRELOAD`: `/bin/sh` will crash when executed with this wrong version of libc. (This issue means that any normal finish involving getting a shell probably won't work). But we recall the secret `print_file` function: we can simply call `print_file("cat.txt")`. Now that we know what to do, we give our exploit script (with useful comments):
```python
